## wireguard-roadwarrior
Wireguard VPN road warrior installation for Debian

This script will let you setup your own VPN server, even if you haven't used Wireguard VPN before.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fruxlabs/wireguard-roadwarrior/master/wireguard-install.sh -O wireguard-install.sh && bash wireguard-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall Wireguard VPN.

This project is under development and may contains stability issues. Feel free to contact me in case of issue/s in script.
Use it at the risk of your own debugging skills.
Feedback is appriciated.
